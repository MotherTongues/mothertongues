Remember: Getting dictionary data together can take a long time. You can always upload a small subset to play around with the dictionary in the meantime.

!!! Important

    Uploading data.csv will result in the data being published to your public github page. If you do not want public access to your dictionary, you must follow the [advanced developer guide](/developer/prerequisites).

For more details on preparing your dictionary data, see [Preparing Your Data](/guides/prepare)
