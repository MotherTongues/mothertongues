# No Code Installation

### What you need to know to understand this article
I’ve re-written this article to be a centered towards users who might not have a web development environment installed on their computer.

Regardless, in order to do this, you’ll have to your hands dirty in some code. If that already sounds intimidating, hopefully you continue to read on a bit - it might be scary at first but it gets easier! Remember there are a lot of resources online to help you and you can always reach out to me if you have questions.

    To start, you need a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) and a text editor for code (I like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

### Step 1: Get the Code
fork

### Step 2: Turn on GitHub Actions

### Step 3: Add your data
data.csv location and update instructions

Remember: Getting dictionary data together can take a long time. You can always upload a small subset to play around with the dictionary in the meantime.

!!! Important

    Uploading data.csv will result in the data being published to your public github page. If you do not want public access to your dictionary, you must follow the [advanced developer guide](/developer/prerequisites).

For more details on preparing your dictionary data, see [Preparing Your Data](/guides/prepare)

### Step 4: See your dictionary!
