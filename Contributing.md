# Contributing to MotherTongues

Feel free to dive in! [Open an issue](https://github.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues/issues/new) or submit PRs.

This repo follows the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/) Code of Conduct.

This repo uses automated tools to standardize the formatting of code, text files and
commits.
 - [Pre-commit hooks](#pre-commit-hooks) validate and automatically apply code
   formatting rules.
 - [gitlint](#enforced-commit-message-formatting) is used as a commit message hook to validate that
   commit messages follow the convention.

## Install Locally
Before installing the repo locally, make sure you have the following on your machine:
-  Git
- Python 3.8+
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
-  Node 16+

Then follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone repo and UI submodule
git clone https://github.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues.git --recursive
# Build the UI:
cd mothertongues/mothertongues-UI && npm install
# Build the Python Development version of the UI:
npx nx build mtd-mobile-ui --configuration=pydev
# Install the Python package:
cd .. && poetry install --with dev,docs
```

!!! tip

    If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can add the [schema to your for intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#:~:text=The%20association%20of%20a%20JSON,under%20the%20property%20json.schemas%20.)!

    ```json
    "json.schemas": [
            {
                "fileMatch": [
                    "config.mtd.json"
                ],
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues/main/mothertongues/schemas/config.json"
            }
        ]
    ```
    For Emacs with [lsp-mode](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/) you can add this to your `.emacs`
    file (or use `M-x customize-variable lsp-json-schemas`):

    ```lisp
    (setq lsp-json-schemas
      `[(:fileMatch ["config.mtd.json"]
         :url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues/main/mothertongues/schemas/config.json")])
    ```



## Set up Pre-commit Hooks

You will need to pip install these packages in each environment:
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [gitlint](https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/)

Then run the following commands in each of your python environments to enable our pre-commit hooks and commitlint:

```sh
pre-commit install
gitlint install-hook
git submodule foreach 'pre-commit install'
git submodule foreach 'gitlint install-hook'
```

And you're ready to start contributing!

!!! important

  You have to run the second command in every sandbox you create, so please don't forget to do so when you clone a new sandbox!

## Enforced Commit Message Formatting
Contributions to mothertongues will only be accepted if commit messages conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Luckily, one of the pre-commit hooks you just installed will validate this locally for you!

Convential commits look like this:

    type(optional-scope): subject (i.e., short description)

    optional body, which is free form

    optional footer

Valid types: (these are the default, which we're using as is for now)
 - build: commits for the build system
 - chore: maintain the repo, not the code itself
 - ci: commits for the continuous integration system
 - docs: adding and changing documentation
 - feat: adding a new feature
 - fix: fixing something
 - perf: improving performance
 - refactor: refactor code
 - revert: undo a previous change
 - style: working only on code or documentation style
 - test: commits for testing code

Valid scopes: the scope is optional and usually refers to which module is being changed.
 - TBD - for now not validated, should be just one word ideally

Valid subject: short, free form, what the commit is about in less than 50 or 60 characters
(not strictly enforced, but it's best to keep it short)

Optional body: this is where you put all the verbose details you want about the commit, or
nothing at all if the subject already says it all. Must be separated by a blank line from
the subject. Explain what the changes are, why you're doing them, etc, as necessary.

Optional footer: separated from the body (or subject if body is empty) by a blank line,
lists reference (e.g.: "Closes #12" "Ref #24") or warns of breaking changes (e.g.,
"BREAKING CHANGE: explanation").

These rules are inspired by these commit formatting guides:
 - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
 - [Bluejava commit guide](https://github.com/bluejava/git-commit-guide)
 - [develar's commit message format](https://gist.github.com/develar/273e2eb938792cf5f86451fbac2bcd51)
 - [AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y).



## More Info About the Pre-commit Hooks

We systematically use a number of pre-commit hooks to
normalize formatting of code. [Follow the installation steps above](#set-up-pre-commit-hooks) to have these used automatically when you do your own commits.

Pre-commit hooks enabled:
- check-yaml validates YAML files
- end-of-file-fixer makes sure each text file ends with exactly one newline character
- trailing-whitespace removes superfluous whitespace at the end of lines in text files
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) enforces good Python style rules; more info about
  using Flake8 in pre-commit hooks at:
  [Lj Miranda flake8 blog post](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/)
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) orders python imports in a standard way
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), the Uncompromising Code Formatter, refortmats all
  Python code according to very strict rules we've agreed to follow; more info about Black
  formatting rules in
  [The Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html)
- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) runs type checking for any statically-typed Python code in
  the repo
