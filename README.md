MTD is the first of two open-source tools that allow language communities and developers to quickly and inexpensively make their dictionary data digitally accessible. MTD is a tool that parses and prepares your data for being used with an MTD User Interface. Currently [mobile](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues-ui) and [web](https://github.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues-UI-Web) are supported.

Please visit the [website](https://www.mothertongues.org) or [docs](https://docs.mothertongues.org) for more information.

## Background

This project started as just a single dictionary for Gitxsan - a language spoken in Northern British Columbia, but it became quickly apparent that many communities also had the same problem. That is, they had some dictionary data but all of the options for sharing that data online were prohibitively expensive. MTD aims to make it easier to create online digital dictionary resources.

**Note** - Just because you _can_ make an online dictionary does _not_ mean you _should_. Before making a dictionary, you must have clear consent from the language community in order to publish a dictionary. For some background on why this is important, please read sections 1 and 2.1 [here](http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-8)

## Install

It is recommended to install mothertongues using pip. The package name is `mothertongues`, and as of version 1.0.x it is imported with `import mothertongues`. The CLI can be run using either `mothertongues` or `mtd`.

```
pip install mothertongues
```

## Usage

In order to create a Mother Tongues Dictionary you will need at least two things:

- A configuration file for you language/dictionary
- A configuration file for each source of data

You can find out more about how to create these files against the MTD configuration schema by visiting the [guides](https://docs.mothertongues.org/docs/mtd-guides)

Once you have those files, you can either create a dictionary using the command line interface.

The basic workflow for creating a dictionary is as follows:

1. Fork and clone the [mtd-starter](https://github.com/roedoejet/mtd-starter)
2. [Edit and prepare](https://docs.mothertongues.org/docs/mtd-guides-prepare) the repo using your own data
3. [Export your data](https://docs.mothertongues.org/docs/mtd-guides-ui#exporting-your-data) to a format readable by the Mother Tongues User Interfaces
4. Chose an interface, either [mobile](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues-ui) or [web](https://github.com/MotherTongues/mothertongues-UI-Web)
5. Add your exported data (`config.js` and `dict_cached.js`) from step 3 and then [publish](https://docs.mothertongues.org/docs/mtd-guides-publishing) your dictionary! ðŸŽ‰

TODO:

- investigate speed for calculating bm25
- export to format used by demo - `poetry run python3 mothertongues/cli.py export ~/Desktop/test_mtd/config.json --no-single-file` - might require change to namedtuple format.

- Continue to do test-driven development for loading dictionaries, validating data and exporting to standard format.
